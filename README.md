# Lead capture test

# How it works:

1) home/ index page  which you see first  is represented here as an advertisement. Lead will click button "find out today" in order to get to the Landing page. 
2) Landing page is meant to collect lead info the only restriction is email it must be entered, otherwise it is not a good lead. I would implement captha on this page  so DB won't be filled with some garbage but  I didn't implemented it, no need to spend more time. After lead captured   I take him to a thanks page  jsut to notify lead that he will be contacted if needed.
3) Dashboard page is here to show a table with all the leads captured (if list gets bigger I have  arrow up to list back to the top, hidden by default) By clicking on info icon User can  see a little popup with more detailed information about lead, by clicking anywhere this popup is closing itself. I could implement a pagination if I had more time to mess with it
4) This Website is  fully  responsive - I used bootstrap and some other libraries to make it pretty :)
